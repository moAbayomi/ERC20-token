# Training 5 Assignment 
## Deployment and Verification of an ERC20 solidity contract on the Arbitrum Sepolia chain

ERC20 solidity smart contract on ArbitrumÂ Sepolia.

# BIH Token Smart Contract

This Ethereum smart contract implements the BIH Token, an ERC-20 token. The contract is deployed and verified at the address `0x4D8E1a96162A6E9741581B261C139Bef5eED811e`. The BIH Token contract is built on the OpenZeppelin framework, leveraging the ERC-20 standard for token functionality.

## Token Details

- **Name:** BIH Token
- **Symbol:** BIH
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000 BIH

## Smart Contract Structure

The BIH Token contract inherits from the OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract, providing standard ERC-20 functionality. The constructor sets the initial parameters for the token, including the name, symbol, and initial supply. The initial supply of 1,000,000 BIH tokens is minted to the deployer's address.

## Deployment Information

The BIH Token contract has been deployed to the Ethereum blockchain with the following details:

- **Contract Address:** [0x4D8E1a96162A6E9741581B261C139Bef5eED811e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4D8E1a96162A6E9741581B261C139Bef5eED811e)
